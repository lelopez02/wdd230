            <picture><img src="image/300px_x_400px_gray_blur.jpg" data-src="image/obelisco.webp" alt="Obelisk img" /></picture>
                <p>It is located in the Plaza de la República, at the intersection of Corrientes and 9 de Julio Avenues,
                    in the
                    neighborhood of San Nicolás in Buenos Aires.
                    <br><br>
                    The Obelisk of Buenos Aires is a historical monument considered an icon of the Autonomous City of
                    Buenos
                    Aires, the capital of Argentina. It was built in 1936 on the occasion of the fourth centenary of the
                    so-called
                    first foundation of Buenos Aires by Pedro de Mendoza.
                    <br><br>
                    The Obelisk, was the main stage in the party that started the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, when it
                    became a giant
                    vertical screen where with an amazing game of lights and sounds a countdown was performed.

            <picture><img src="image/300px_x_400px_gray_blur.jpg" data-src="image/floralis.webp" alt="flora img" /></picture>
                <p>The Floralis Genérica is a metallic sculpture located in the Plaza de las Naciones Unidas, Avenida
                    Figueroa
                    Alcorta, in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It was inaugurated on April 13, 2002.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the features of the flower is an electrical system that automatically opens and closes the
                    petals
                    depending on the time of day. During the night, the flower closes, emanating a red glow from its
                    interior to
                    be reborn open in the morning of the following day. This same mechanism is the one that closes the
                    flower in
                    strong winds, emulating the process of photonastia of nature.
                    <br><br>
                    It opens every morning at 8 a.m. and closes at sunset, on a schedule that changes according to the
                    season of
                    the year. When it was inaugurated, its petals did not close due to technical problems that were
                    solved two
                    months later.

                    and its
                    view of the river make this district one of the most valued in Buenos Aires.

                <p>Surrounded by the Palermo Woods, the Japanese Garden is a corner of Buenos Aires. It is the largest
                    Japanese-style garden outside of Japan. Walking through bonsais, azaleas, kokedamas, orchids and
                    concrete
                    lanterns is an unforgettable pleasure. It also has a Chashitsu (tea house): a space specially built
                    to carry
                    out the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Ornamented with traditional elements, whose interior was
                    imported
                    from Japan, some of its components date back more than a hundred years. Its exquisite interior is
                    handcrafted.
                    An art room and a restaurant complete the visit.
                    <br><br>

                    nursery
                    where you can buy plants (bonsai) and food for the fish in the lake; and a store with Japanese

                    room
                    with three hundred and sixty reclining seats and a dome of twenty meters in diameter where about
                    8,900 stars,
                    planets and satellites of the universe are reproduced, thanks to an impressive equipment (unique in
                    Latin
                    America) containing six Sky-Skan projectors with 8K resolution, which means that the dome contains
                    38 million
                    pixels.
                    <br><br>
